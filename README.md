# nodeschool

Sometimes, we run through [nodeschool](http://nodeschool.io)'s tutorial during our Coding Dojos.

Each tutorial should be in a dedicated subfolder:
* [learnyounode](https://github.com/rvagg/learnyounode): [see our work](https://github.com/coding-dojo-wlg/nodeschool/tree/master/learnyounode)
